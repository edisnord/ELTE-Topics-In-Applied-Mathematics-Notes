** Recall: Proving the convergence of a sequence

The sequence $(x_n)$ converges to a real number $x$ if for an arbitrary $\epsilon > 0$, there exists a $N \in \mathbb{N}$ so that for all $n > N$, $|x_n - x| < \epsilon$

The formal definition of a convergent sequence:

\begin{gather*}
\forall \varepsilon > 0, \exists N \in \mathbb{N} : |x_n - x| < \varepsilon, \ \forall n > N.
\end{gather*}

*** Topoligical version (using $\epsilon$-neighborhoods):

The sequence $(x_n)$ converges to $x$, if given any $\epsilon$-neighborhood $V_\epsilon(x)$ of a, there exists a point in the sequence
after which all of the terms are in $V_\epsilon(a)$. In other words, every $\epsilon$-neighborhood contains all but a finite number
of the terms of $(x_n)$
